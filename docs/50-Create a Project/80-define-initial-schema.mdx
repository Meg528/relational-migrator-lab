# Define Initial Schema

Relational Migrator gives you three options on how your MongoDB schema should be created. Regardless of which option you choose,
you can manually modify your schema later. 

Select “Start with a recommended MongoDB schema”

You are asked which of the tables should represented as a collection in MongoDB. 

Select the five collections that we want:

- authors
- books
- issue_detials
- reviews
- users

Any tables you did not check will be embedded in other collections.
