# ðŸ“˜ Schema in PostgreSQL

The following screenshot shows an Entity-Relationship diagram of the relational database we wish to migrate. This is a Library management app, that stores information about Books, where a Book can have many Authors, an Author can write many books, users can borrow books and leave reviews.

This is the sample schema we use during our [Developer Days's Intro Lab](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/intro-lab/docs/importing-data/intro).
