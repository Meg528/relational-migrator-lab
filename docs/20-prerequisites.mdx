# ðŸ¦– Prerequisites 



## MongoDB Atlas

As we'll be importing data from a Relational Database into MongoDB Atlas, you'll need a MongoDB Atlas account and a free forever M0 Cluster.

To get yours, follow the instructions on the [Intro Lab](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/intro-lab/docs/mongodb-atlas/what-is-mongodb)

:::tip
You can also import into your own on-premises, or container hosted cluster of MongoDB, including MongoDB Community Edition.
