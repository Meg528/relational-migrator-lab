# üëê Prerequisites 

## 1. PostgreSQL Database

In this lab you will be migrating data from a PostgreSQL relational database. You have a few options to set up this database.

### Option 1: Use pre-configured database

If you are participating in an instructor-led lab, they may have already set up this database for you. Ask your instructor for the 
connection URI and credentials.

### Option 2: Load the schema and data into your own PostgreSQL server

If you already have a PostgreSQL server set up, you can import the schema and data used in this lab. Download the file 
[1-library-schema-and-data.sql](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/relational-migrator-lab/docker/sample-postgres-library/init/1-library-schema-and-data.sql)
file and load it using psql or [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/).

### Option 3: Run a PostgreSQL container using Docker

If you don't have an existing PostgreSQL server but have Docker installed, you can easily load a container pre-configured with 
PostgreSQL and the sample database:

1. Clone or download the code from this lab's [Github repo](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/relational-migrator-lab).
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the repo root
3. Build the Docker image by running the command: 
```
docker build -f ./docker/sample-postgres-library/Dockerfile -t sample-postgres-library .
```
4. Start the Docker container by running the command:
```
docker run -p 5432:5432 sample-postgres-library
```
The PostgreSQL server can be accessed at localhost:5432 with a username of `postgres` and a password of `postgres`.

## 2. MongoDB Database

As we'll be importing data from a Relational Database into MongoDB, you'll need to have a MongoDB database. You have a 
few options to set up this database.

### Option 1: New MongoDB Atlas cluster

The easiest way to run MongoDB is to use MongoDB Atlas, our cloud-hosted database offering.
You can set a MongoDB Atlas account and a free forever M0 Cluster.

To get yours, follow the instructions on the [Intro Lab:](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/intro-lab/docs/mongodb-atlas/what-is-mongodb)
- [Create your Account](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/intro-lab/docs/mongodb-atlas/create-account)
- [Deploy a Database Cluster](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/intro-lab/docs/mongodb-atlas/create-cluster)

Be sure to [open up the cluster to allow connections from your local computer](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/atlas/network-connections/#overview), and configure a database user with the readWriteAnyDatabase role. 

### Option 2: Use existing cluster

If you have an existing MongoDB Atlas, Enterprise or Community cluster, you can use it as the migration target. Make sure you
know the URI for the cluster, and have a database user with the readWriteAnyDatabase role. 

### Option 3: Run a MongoDB container using Docker


If you don't have an existing PostgreSQL server but have Docker installed, you can easily load a container pre-configured with 
MongoDB by running the following command:

```
docker run -p 27017:27017 mongo
```

This will launch an empty MongoDB community cluster on localhost:27017, suitable to use for this lab. 
You can connect with no username or password. Since this command does not use Docker volumes, any data will be lost when the container is stopped.
## 3. Download and install MongoDB Relational Migrator


Now you will need to go to the [MongoDB Relational Migrator downloads page](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/relational-migrator), select your OS, download and install it. Once installed, 
run it and it will be running on a browser at http://127.0.0.1:8080.
