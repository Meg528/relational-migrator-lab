# üëê Change genres in books

We want to modify the MongoDB schema so that each book's genres are represented as an array of strings. We'll have data duplication, as genres will get copied on each book. This is a good strategy if the duplicated data does not change often.

We'll go from the proposed array of objects:

```json
bookGenres: [
    {
        bookId: "Some Book Id",
        genres: "fiction"
    },
    {
        bookId: "Some Book Id",
        genres: "novel"
    }
]
```

to an array of primitive values

```json
genres: [ "fiction", "novel" ]
```

- On the MongoDB diagram view, click the `books` collection
- On the relational mappings list on the right, click on the edit icon of `book_genre` embedded array
- Change the field name from `bookGenres` to `genres`
- Uncheck `bookId`
- In the advanced settings, check `create array of primitive values`
- Click `Save and close`
