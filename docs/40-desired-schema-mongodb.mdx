# ðŸ“˜ Desired Schema in MongoDB

Since MongoDB is a document database, you have more flexibility in how you model your data. When migrating from
a relational database to MongoDB, it's important to consider how your data is accessed, and model the data such 
that data that is frequently accessed together is stored together by using embedded documents and arrays. 

The following screenshot shows the MongoDB schema we will be creating in this lab.
