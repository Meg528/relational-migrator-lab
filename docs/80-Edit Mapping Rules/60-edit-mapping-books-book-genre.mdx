# Edit mapping to books collection (from book_genre table)

We want to modify the MongoDB schema so that each book's genres are represented as an array of strings. 

- On the MongoDB diagram view, click the `books` collection
- On the relational mappings list on the right, click on the edit icon of `book_genre` embedded array
- Change the field name from `bookGenres` to `genres`
- Uncheck `bookId`
- In the advanced settings, check `create array of primitive values`
- Click `Save and close`
