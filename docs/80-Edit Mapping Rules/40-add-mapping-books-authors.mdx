# Add mapping to books collection (from authors table)

We want to modify the MongoDB schema so that each book contains an array of its authors.
In this step we will embed the book details into the empty array from the join tabe. 

- On the MongoDB diagram view, click the `books` collection
- On the relational mappings list on the right, click `+ Add`
- Select `Embedded documents`
- Select `authors` as Source table
- In the advanced settings, check 'Merge fields into parent`
- Check the `id` and `name` fields and uncheck the rest
- Click `Save and close`
