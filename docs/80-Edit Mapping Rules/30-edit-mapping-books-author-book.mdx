# üëê Edit mapping to books collection (from author_book table)

We want to modify the MongoDB schema so that each book contains an array of its authors.
In this step we will remove the redundant ID fields from the join table. 

- On the MongoDB diagram view, click the `books` collection
- On the relational mappings list on the right, click on the edit icon of `author_book`
- Edit the field name from `authorBooks` to just `authors`
- In the list of fields, uncheck `authorId` and `bookId`, leaving all fields unchecked. 
- Click `Save and close`
